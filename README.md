# Convolutional neural network 
This is an example of a deep learning model. It involves Convolution, pooling, flattening, full conncetion of layers and an ouput layer which can be customised accoriding to our desired output (continous, binary, categorical etc).
This model takes an image as input and predicts whether it is a dog or a cat. It's pretty fascinating that machine can just see an image and learn so many features in the image to classify the thing it is seeing.
